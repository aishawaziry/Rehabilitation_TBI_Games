          "Therapy to address motor issues and muscle weakness as brain injuries can cause floppiness or stiffness. This may include strength training, stretching exercises, balance exercise, and encouraging neuroplasticity—the “rewiring” of the brain to form new pathways using undamaged areas of the brain to send and receive signals",

          "Behavior management therapy to address changes in behavior and mood caused by impacts on the region of the brain controlling impulse control, reasoning, inhibition, and judgment",

          "There are many options for rehabilitation therapies after a brain injury, including social support and counseling. Families are encouraged to join support groups and attend family therapy sessions with their injured loved ones.",
      "6":
          "The amount and length of time undergoing these therapies depend on the severity of the brain injury and how well each patient responds. Some patients return to full function and independence while others require lifelong care. The majority of patients fall somewhere in the middle of this range.",

      "Seated Hip Internal/External Rotation": "For this brain injury recovery exercise, you will need a towel. Start in a seated position, and place a towel under your foot to make it easier to move. Then, slide your foot towards your midline and push your legs outward to the side. Use your hands to assist if necessary. Repeat 10 times, then switch to the other leg. Do 3 sets of 10.",
      "Seated Hip Abduction/Adduction": "Begin by sitting in a chair and holding one leg slightly above the floor. Then, kick your leg out slowly as far as you can, then inward toward your midline. This can also be done by sliding your whole leg out and in on a towel. Aim for 3 sets of 10 as well on each side.",
      "Seated Marching": "This TBI exercise is performed in a seated position while maintaining tall, upright posture. First, lift your knee up toward your chest and hold for 1-2 seconds. Then, slowly bring it back down. Repeat alternating sides for a total of 20 repetitions. This can be done passively by using your arms or actively using just your leg strength.",
      "Straight Leg Raises": "Straight leg raises are a great traumatic brain injury recovery exercise to develop quadriceps strength. Lay flat on your back either on the floor or a bed with one knee bent. With the other leg, straighten the knee and lift your leg upwards. Make sure to keep your knee fully straight by contracting your thigh muscles as you lift your leg up and down. You can wrap a resistance band around your ankles to make it more challenging. Try to do 3 sets of 10 on each leg.",

      "Forward Punches": "While seated, clasp your hands together and slowly punch forward while keeping your arms parallel to the floor. Lean forward as far as you can. Then, use your back muscles to pull your trunk back to an upright position. You should feel this in your shoulders, back, and core. Repeat about 10 times, but make sure to stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort in your back.",
      "Seated Trunk Extension": "Another helpful core exercise for brain injury recovery is seated trunk extension. For this exercise, sit in a chair with your arms crossed over your chest. Then, bend at the waist to slowly lean forward as far as you can safely without falling over. Then, use your back muscles to push yourself back up. Again, you may use your arms to give yourself a boost. Repeat 3 sets of 15.",
      "Seated Oblique Crunches": "This is one of the more advanced TBI exercises on this list and may take a little more coordination. Start sitting tall in a chair with your arms crossed over your chest or hands behind your head. Then, crunch your right elbow to your left knee by bringing them together, then returning back to an upright position. Alternate sides and repeat for a total of 20 repetitions.",

      "Weight Shifts": "Weight shifts are great exercises for the early stages of brain rehabilitation. First, stand up with your feet shoulder-width apart and your weight equally distributed on both feet. Then, shift your weight to your right foot and lift your left foot slightly off the ground. Hold for up to 30 seconds or as long as you can while maintaining good form. Try to keep tall posture and avoid leaning over. Then return to your starting position and repeat about 5 times on each side.",
      "Romberg Stance": "Stand with your feet touching together and eyes closed. (To ease into it, you can hold on to the back of a chair with both hands). The goal is to stand for 2 minutes, but only hold for as long as you can. You may feel your body sway when you close your eyes, but that is completely normal because your brain typically relies on your vision to help keep you oriented. When vision is removed, your brain has to adjust and use a different sense (proprioception) to help you balance. Thus, you are activating a different part of your brain which is great for TBI recovery.",
      "Tandem/Staggered Stance": "Another popular balance exercise for TBI survivors is the tandem stance. For this exercise, stand upright with one foot slightly in front of the other, with the heel of one foot lined up with the toes of the other. Hold for about 30-60 seconds, then switch to your other foot. If this is too difficult, try staggering your feet with a little more space between them. The wider your base of support is, the more stable you`ll feel. To increase the difficulty, you can try this balance exercise with your eyes closed.",
      "Alternating Heel-Toe Raises": "This TBI exercise strengthens your calves and ankle dorsiflexors, but helps you practice the heel-to-toe weight-shift that is needed for proper gait. To perform these, hold on to the back of a chair and rise to your tiptoes slowly for about 10 times, making sure to keep your weight equally distributed through both feet. To increase difficulty, you can close your eyes as well. These are especially helpful for brain injury rehabilitation because they can help improve your coordination and gait.",

      "Pushing Movement": "Place a water bottle on the left side of the table within your range of motion. Then, hook your wrist on the outside of the bottle and use your arm to slowly push it straight across the table. With the same movement, push the bottle back in the opposite direction. Repeat 10 times on each arm.",
      "Bicep Curls": "For this TBI exercise, hold a water bottle in your hand and rest your arm by your side. Then with your elbow glued to your side, flex your bicep to bring the water bottle up to your shoulder. Finally, bring your arm back down as slowly as you can. By slowly performing the exercise, you`re developing more control and stability. Repeat 10 times on each side.",
      "Shoulder Flexion": "This TBI exercise can help strengthen your shoulder muscles after brain injury. First, hold a water bottle in your hand and rest your hand in your lap. Then, lift your arm up to a 90-degree angle in front of you until your hand is at your eye level (make sure your arm is fully extended). Hold for about 5 seconds, then slowly bring your arm back down to your lap. Repeat 10 times on each arm. If you`re feeling any pinching in your shoulder, check your posture and try lifting your arm up with your thumb rotated upward. This places the shoulder in a more neutral position that is less susceptible to impingement.",
      "Shoulder Abduction": "This is similar to the previous TBI exercise, but instead of lifting forward you`ll be raising your arm to the side. Both exercises can be done holding onto a water bottle, light weight, or a resistance band. While holding one end of the band, sit on top of the other end, or place it under one foot depending on the length of your band. Then, extend your arm (the one holding the band) straight out to your side. Loop the band around your hand to keep your grip. Finally, with your arm straight out, raise your arm as high as you can above your shoulder. Then with slow and controlled movement, bring it back down. Aim to repeat 3 sets of 10 exercises on each arm.",
